<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>ECHO is a delay emulation tool for analog space missions. It allows users to send and receive messages 
both in a public and private setting. Public messages are sent to every user (both on the analog habitat
and mission control), while private messages are 1-on-1 discussions with another individual. The application
allows users to send text, audio, video, and file attachments. </p>
